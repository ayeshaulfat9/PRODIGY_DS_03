# PRODIGY_DS_03
My 3rd Task of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. I have built a decision tree classifier using bank data.
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 
Attached the dataset aswell for your ease.
